## What is this project?
queenslandkids.org.au - The biggest problem that Queensland Kids and their families are facing is being able to access the services and information available to them.

Our aim is to create a mobile or general web site for families allowing family to shine a beacon in the positive direction towards seeking help and finding resources. The problems today is a lot of those resources are scattered in various parts of the internet or medical services will hand you a info sheet, which may of completely irrelevant.

Second challenge is how do we share the information on the site accessible and securely/confidentially to family members, emergency services, doctors, nurses and service providers
